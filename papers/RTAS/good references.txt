A recent report [1] suggested that of the 284,798 deaths that occurred among patients that involved one or more patient safety incidents between 2003 and 2005, 247,662 were potentially preventable. Hence, there is a need to increase the use of devices that can automatically check for safety constraints.


Recent initiatives have been launched to increase the interoperability of medical devices to reduce medical accidents caused by such human errors [3]. One such initiative is the work on the Integrated Clinical Environment (ICE) draft standard [4]. It aims to provide integration of data and devices to enable real-time decision support and safety interlocks thus ensuring patient safety. The program covers a wide range of required efforts, from eliciting high- level clinical scenario to defining regulatory for patient-centric networked medical devices [5]. Some practical prototypes are developed and open platforms are constructed, to evaluate and realize the approaches [6, 7].
