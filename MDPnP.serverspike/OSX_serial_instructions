Instructions for getting serial communication working on OSX

1. the MDPnP.serverspike project should have the RXTX jar file
already in its build path with the native library location already
set. This native library is for java 1.6 64 bit on OSX 10.5 only (which is what
the mac minis that we have run)

2. for the USB serial adapter, you need to get the driver for it
from http://internap.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/osx-pl2303/osx-pl2303-0.3.1-10.4-universal.dmg

3. you can install minicom for direct terminal to the devices at
